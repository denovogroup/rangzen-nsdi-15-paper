\subsection{System Design}
This is the part where we describe the design of Rangzen. We point backward
to the CCS paper to justify the design theoretically and explain how the system
design targets the goals described in the background (and does not target the
non-goals described there).

\subsection{Implementation}
This is the part where we describe what we implemented, how many lines of
code it is, what features of Rangzen it includes.

\subsection{Choices}
This is the part where we talk about interesting choices we made in building
and/or designing Rangzen.
